The download-clojure script is used to download the latest clojure
and clojure-contrib src, build and copy the jars to $CLJ_JARS dir.

The shell script 'clj' is used to start the repl or run a 
clojure script from the command line.  

The repl-init.clj initializes the REPL and then starts it up.  This
script is called by the 'clj' script if no args are passed in.
