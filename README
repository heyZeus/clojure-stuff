The download-clojure shell script is used to download the latest clojure
and clojure-contrib src, build and copy the jars to $CLJ_JARS dir.

The clj shell script is used to start the repl or run a clojure script 
from the command line.  

The repl-init.clj script initializes the REPL and then starts it up.  This
script is called by the 'clj' script if no args are passed in. 

The update-desktop-image.clj will download a random image and update your
Gnome background.
